The purpose of these calculators are to aid engineers, electricians, and energy system designers to make quick calculations on the fly. All that is needed is access to a browser.

Included are calculators for voltage drop, conduit sizing, and wire sizing.

A rotational mass calculator is also included, but is in a beta state and should not be trusted by designers.
